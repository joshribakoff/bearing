# Integration

Bearing integrates with AI coding tools to enforce worktree discipline automatically.

## Available Integrations

| Integration | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Claude Code Hooks](/claude-code-hooks/) | Pre-prompt validation |
| [Slash Commands](/slash-commands/) | Quick status checks |

## Why Integrate?

Without integration, you rely on agents remembering to use worktrees. With integration:

- **Automatic checks** - Violations caught before damage
- **Clear feedback** - Agents know how to fix issues
- **Consistent workflow** - Same rules apply to all agents
