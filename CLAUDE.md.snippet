# Sailkit Worktree Workflow

**CRITICAL:** Never work directly in base project folders. Use git worktrees for isolation.

## Rules

1. **Base folders stay on main** - `fightingwithai.com/`, `bearing-dev/`, etc. must always be on `main`
2. **Create worktrees for tasks** - Each task gets its own worktree: `repo-branch/`
3. **Never switch branches in base folders** - Use `git worktree add`, not `git checkout`

## Commands

```bash
# Create worktree
worktree-new fightingwithai.com feature-branch
# Creates: fightingwithai.com-feature-branch/

# Remove after merge
worktree-cleanup fightingwithai.com feature-branch

# Sync manifest
worktree-sync
```

## Active Worktrees

See `sailkit-dev/WORKTREES.md` for current worktrees across all repos.

## Recovery

If you accidentally switch a base folder off main:
```bash
git -C fightingwithai.com checkout main
```
